# Simple NodeJS/Express Setup to connect to a MYSQL database

## Pre-reqs
• Have `npm` and `node` installed on your local machine
• Have `mysql` installed on your local machine
• Use `MYSQL Workbench` to use a UI to visually see your database
• Have `Postman` installed in order to talk to your server-side routes

### How to run the server app
• Run `npm install` to install all dependencies required for this application. You can check out what these dependencies are by looking at the `depencies` key in the `packages.json` file
• Run `npm run start` to run it after `npm install` is finished. The reason why this works is because I created a script called `npm run start` in the `scripts` key in `packages.json`
